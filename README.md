1. 3 classes were created to manage the history, the audios and the playback of the audios.
1.1 The history class is in charge of mapping the story with its corresponding narrative, options and audios. 
1.2 The Sound class is in charge of obtaining the audio information and saves its corresponding information.
1.3 The SoundConfigure class is in charge of obtaining the list of objects of type Sound and has a method that is in charge of playing the audios.
2. The narrative is composed by a dictionary which contains: the text, the sound configuration and the options, these last ones contain the key of the next element.
All audios had to be set to mono in order to be used with OpenAL and 3D sound. The SoundNoEdit folder contains the audios before being converted to mono and the Sounds folder already has the audios converted to mono.
